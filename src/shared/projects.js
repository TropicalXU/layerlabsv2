The checkout experience is quick and easy, make a purchase within seconds.',
            description: "Shirley's Art Studio is an online gallery website with a built in online store which feature secure payments using Stripe. At Layerlabs I wanted to re-create a live art gallery, showcasing and displaying each of Shirley's art pieces. This was key to creating the look and feel of the website. We wanted to make sure the paintings brought out the color while the website theme remained clean. I implemented a responsive design, suitable for all devices as well as clear navigation tools, Search Engine Optimization and security features. With all of this implemented Shirley was thrilled with the end result. Having her own website to showcase and sell her artwork allows Shirley a platform to share her work beyond the gallery and reach even more enthusiastic art lovers who can now get in touch from anywhere in the world.",

A register and sign in modal is included in the applications navbar so that users can easily access and manage their account. A review button will allow the user to leave a review, this will appear as a form inside a modal using form validation.
